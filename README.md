This project is a book library to practice basic JavaScript. The book library should include the following:

- Use OOJ (constructor functions) to add books
- Create, append, and remove elements from the DOM
- Save data to local storage
- Have two different versions: 1 using ES5 constructor syntax, 1 using ES6 class syntax

Optional:
- Add booklists based upon tags/categories or read/not-read
